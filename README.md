### Project Title
bikeshare_github

### Description
I completed this R project as part of my Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree.

With subsets of the bikeshare dataset, I answered questions about trip durations overall and between cities. I also looked at differences in median trip durations between subscribers and customers in each city. I used summary statistics and visualized trip duration data using ggplot2 and dplyr
